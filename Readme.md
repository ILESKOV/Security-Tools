- [MythX](https://mythx.io/) - MythX is a professional-grade cloud service that uses symbolic analysis and input fuzzing to [detect
common security bugs](https://medium.com/consensys-diligence/detecting-the-top-4-critical-smart-contract-vulnerabilities-with-mythx-9c568d7db7a6) and [verify the correctness of smart contract code](https://medium.com/coinmonks/advanced-smart-contract-security-verification-in-remix-9630b43695e5). Using MythX requires an API key from [mythx.io.](https://mythx.io/)
